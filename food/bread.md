- Drop into the flowered cloth with pinch side down
- Seal on top with the cookie sheat
- Proof for 2ish hours

### Phase 3 (.5
- Preheat oven 500°F at least a half-hour with rack in lower middle position
- Flip the sheet and small bowl combo upside down, so that the cookie sheet is upside down and the bread is on top of it
- Remove the bowl, then the cloth
- Put a little water in the big bowl, and pour it out, but it will still be wet
- Place big bowl on top of the bread, place in oven
- Turn oven down to 450°F and let bake for 20 minutes
- Remove bowl, let it bake another 20ish minutes
- Wait until it cools down, theoretically but yeah.
